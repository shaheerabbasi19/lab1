# Exercise 1: Navigation

This exercise is an introduction to terminal command.
An example solution is in the _solution_ folder.

Try to achieve the following tasks.  When done, write the command you
used in this file underneath the particular question.

1. Open your terminal (command prompt), either gitbash on windows or
   terminal on mac.
   
   I search gitbash in my search tab and pull up the application. 
   
2. Which directory are you in?  Find it out!  Hint: `pwd`

  /c/Users/Shaheer  

3. Navigate to your "Documents" directory (or wherever else you keep
   your stuff).  Hint: `cd`
   
   cd Documents
   
4. Print out the working directory--are you in the correct place?

  /c/Users/Shaheer/Documents. I am not in the right place. 

5. List the files there.  Do you see the same files and in the file
   explorer?  Hint: `ls`
   
217_Lecture_The_Road_to_Brown.pdf
'5.10.22 Intern Binder.docx'
 Acrobat_DC_Web_x64_WWMUI/
 Acrobat_DC_Web_x64_WWMUI.zip
 Auto.data
'Custom Office Templates'/
 Figure.pdf
'In-Progress Presentation (Shaheer).pptx'

I do see the same files in the file explorer and the files listed. 


6. Navigate back to the home folder.  Use the dedicated shortcut for
   home folder.  Hint `~`.

I used ~ to return to /c/Users/Shaheer

7. Commit and push your changes.

git commit -am "Working on command line exercise"

8. Check the file on github--do you see your edits there?

No I do not. 
Congrats!  You are done!
